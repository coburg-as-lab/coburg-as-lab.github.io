The mission of the **Coburg Autonomous Systems Lab** is to accelerate the evolution of autonomous intelligence by unifying simulation, scaled RC platforms, and full-scale vehicles into a single deployment pipeline. 

We specialize in **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Machine Learning** frameworks that don't just solve mathematical problems, but thrive in the friction and unpredictability of the physical world. By validating complex algorithms in scaled environments first, we transform theoretical autonomy into **rugged, road-ready engineering**.

To be the premier proving ground for **embodied AI**, where the safety and capability of the next generation’s self-driving vehicles are solved at scale before they ever touch the public highway.

## Motto
> **"Code it. Scale it. Drive it."**
